observation:

- the heat flux increaases upon mesh refinement
- but there is no thermal convection plume observed (no convection observed)
- velocity profile around sphere shows non-zero velocity, convection occurs. But it is about 10x slower


possible source of errors:
- mesh is not fine enough
	- changing the mesh to 10 layers of addition, we get a plume (solved)
- courant number too small -> timestep too small
	- is not the case, Di set at 10, not 0.99
- fvSchemes in the solid directory was changed
	- changing fvSchemes doesn't change much of the solution
