in troublehsooting process,

changing fvSchemes to all upwind schemes doesn't seem to improve stability.

i'm going to try some snappyHexMesh Options. eg. adding layers...

i found that fvSchemes is an important factor in getting steady convergence.

Usually for bad meshes like this one, it is important to get steady convergence...

and linear interpolation schemes are usually the culprit for that since they can easily go unbounded.

so this expt is to see how the changing of certain schemes affect the solving of this case





expt_case readme%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
this tests the effect of mesh refinement only to higher levels

high mesh refinement introduces system instabilities...

reducing relaxation factors, tolerances and even timestep doesn't help...


next i was looking into the fvSchemes file and studying the interpolation schemes

i found out that for non-orthogonal meshes, correction is required, and sometimes this can cause divergence in solution

this looks good to learn!
